# Aadhaar Enrolment Data Analysis (India)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Aadhaar enrolment data released by the Government of India to understand **state-wise, age-group-wise, and district-level patterns**.  
The goal is to derive **actionable insights** related to enrolment distribution, demographic coverage, and regional disparities using Python-based data analysis.

This is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project focused on real-world public data.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ State-wise Enrolment Analysis
- Top 10 and Bottom 10 states by total enrolments
- Contribution of top 5 states vs remaining states
- Identification of regional concentration patterns

### 2️⃣ Age-group Distribution Analysis
- Overall enrolment distribution across age groups:
  - **0–5 years**
  - **5–17 years**
  - **18+ years**
- Child enrolment share analysis at the state level

### 3️⃣ District-level Analysis (Illustrative)
- District-wise enrolment aggregation for a selected state
- Top and bottom performing districts
- Highlights intra-state enrolment inequality

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Aadhaar enrolments are **unevenly distributed across states**
- A small number of states contribute a **disproportionately large share** of enrolments
- **Children aged 0–5 years form the largest enrolment group**, indicating early-life Aadhaar coverage
- District-level analysis reveals **significant intra-state variation**
- Targeted, region-specific enrolment strategies can improve coverage efficiency

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters
- Helps policymakers identify **under-enrolled regions**
- Supports data-driven planning for **outreach and accessibility**
- Strengthens early-age identity coverage for long-term inclusion
- Demonstrates how public data can inform governance decisions
